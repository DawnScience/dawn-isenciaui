Its convenient to have a common style in shared projects to avoid difficulties with merging etc.

* Write tests
* Use the project specific formatting
* Read http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/performance/bloopers.html - particularly the bit about String.substring
* Write tests
* Keep methods small
* Give methods and classes meaningful names
* Write tests
