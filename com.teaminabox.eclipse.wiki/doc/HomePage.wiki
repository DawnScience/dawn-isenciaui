'''Wiki Plugin Overview'''

I am writing this design overview for two reasons:
* So that I can explain myself and therefore hope to receive guidance on how I might have done things better
* So that others building editors can see how it was done.

Further details about the plugin can be found on SourceForge: http://eclipsewiki.sourceforge.net

And ThankYou

'''How to read these documents ?'''

These documents are written as a Wiki and so the best way to read them is in Eclipse with the Wiki plugin.
Set up the project as follows:
* Create a project called 'wiki'
* Add the src in a directory called src
* Add these documents in a directory called doc

If you do this then the references to source code will work.
